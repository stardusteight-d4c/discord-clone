   Discord, Real-time Communication Channels
</h1>

An instant messaging application designed to offer a real-time communication experience. This robust chat platform was developed using a variety of modern technologies to create an immersive and interactive user experience.

Users can create and join various themed chat rooms for specific discussions. Each chat room offers a dedicated environment for interaction. The application uses Socket.io to enable real-time communication between users, enabling instant messaging and real-time notifications.

Livekit is built in to support voice and video calling, allowing users to have face-to-face or group conversations directly on the platform. It uses the Clerk library for secure user authentication and authorization, ensuring the protection of personal data. Radix and Shadcn/ui are employed to create an elegant and responsive design, providing a pleasant user experience on mobile and desktop devices.

Zustand is used to manage application state, ensuring data efficiency and consistency. The application uses React Hook Form to create interactive forms and the Zod library for data validation. React Query, part of the tanstack package, is used to effectively manage access to data and queries, improving performance and scalability. The Uploadthing library is used to support sending images, videos and other types of media in conversations.

The application provides a complete chat experience, from text messaging to voice and video communication, all in a secure environment. It is a platform for communities, groups of friends or work teams who want to communicate and collaborate in an effective and engaging way.
